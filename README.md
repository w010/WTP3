Wolo.pl TYPO3 Pack 3


WTP3 is a preconfigured cms package based on TYPO3.

Originally based on my friend Ry≈ºy's old Million12 package.
The "3" in it's name means it's a third branch, based on TYPO3 7.x.
First release WTPACK was for versions 4.x.

For WTP dedicated to TYPO3 version 6.2 check WTP2 repo.
