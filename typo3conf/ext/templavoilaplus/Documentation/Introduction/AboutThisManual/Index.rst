About this manual
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This manual for TemplaVoilà! Plus 7.x isn't complete like it was never for TemplaVoilà.
At the moment it is the old one only imported and some small points are already updated
but it isn't complete yet. Some points in this documentation are outdated and written
for TYPO3 4.5 or older.
So this document maybe non helpfull for newbies. But we will update this documentation
from time to time. If you find something, which isn't clear please fill in an issue
report on the `Project page <https://github.com/pluspol-interactive/templavoilaplus/issues>`_.
