What does it do?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In short, TemplaVoilà! Plus is an alternate templating enginge offering a
new way of creating and working with design elements. On top of that
it provides a new user interface in the backend (aka the “Page
Module”).

The extension “TemplaVoilà!” was developed by Kasper Skårhøj and
Robert Lemke for a project in a large, french company, Dassault Systèmes.
TemplaVoilà! was the result of the innovation that followed some
problem solving for the project. In particular the problems that
TemplaVoilà! addresses are how to create more flexible page structures
than currently known in TYPO3s concept of “columns”. Further, it
integrates traditional templating on the content element level but
with a far more flexible point-n-click style than seen before. Finally
the development of TemplaVoilà! also lead to some enhancements of the
TYPO3 Core, in particular a concept called FlexForms which allows
TYPO3's backend to build hierarchical forms and store their content
into XML structures.
